vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.

gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
the right.

This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
